# Consensus Module

## Purpose
The Consensus module is responsible for block production, validator set management, staking, and finality. It provides the backbone of security and ordering for the DataMesh network.

## Technology
- **Tendermint/CometBFT**: Fast-finality Proof-of-Stake consensus engine.
- **Validator Modularity**: Supports shared security and flexible validator sets.

## Responsibilities
- Block production and finality
- Validator set management
- Staking and slashing
- Shared security (optional)

## Initial Implementation Plan
1. Integrate Tendermint/CometBFT as the consensus engine.
2. Define validator set and staking logic (optionally using Cosmos SDK as a base).
3. Expose APIs for validator registration and consensus status.
