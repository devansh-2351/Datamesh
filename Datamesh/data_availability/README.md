# Data Availability Module

## Purpose
The Data Availability (DA) module ensures that all transaction and state data required for execution and verification is reliably stored, distributed, and provable to all network participants.

## Technology
- **Erasure Coding (Reed-Solomon)**: For robust data redundancy and recovery.
- **KZG Commitments**: For proof-based data availability.
- **Blobstream**: For efficient rollup data posting and sampling.

## Responsibilities
- Storing and distributing transaction/data blobs
- Providing proofs of data availability
- Data Availability Sampling (DAS) for light clients
- Blobstream for rollups

## Initial Implementation Plan
1. Implement erasure coding (Reed-Solomon) for data redundancy.
2. Integrate KZG commitments for proof-based DA.
3. Expose APIs for posting and sampling blobs.
