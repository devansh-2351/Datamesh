# DataMesh: Modular Layer 1 for Scalable Data Availability & Execution

## Abstract

DataMesh is a modular Layer 1 blockchain designed to decouple consensus, execution, and data availability (DA) for scalable, secure, and flexible infrastructure. Inspired by Celestia and EigenLayer, DataMesh is purpose-built for data-intensive dApps‚ÄîAI pipelines, decentralized storage, zero-knowledge proof aggregation, and high-throughput rollups.

---

## Motivation

Traditional blockchains like Ethereum bundle consensus, execution, and DA, limiting scalability and flexibility. DataMesh separates these layers, enabling:
- Rollups to offload DA to a scalable base layer
- Multiple execution environments (EVM, WASM, zkVM)
- Horizontal throughput scaling by plugging in new execution chains

---

## Architecture

**Core Layers:**
- **Consensus:** Fast-finality PoS (Tendermint/CometBFT), modular validator set, shared security
- **Data Availability:** Erasure coding, KZG commitments, blobstream, DAS
- **Execution:** Pluggable VMs (EVM, WASM, zkVM, MoveVM)
- **SDK:** Dev toolkit for launching modular appchains or sovereign rollups

**Visual Diagram:**
(See the previously generated architecture diagram.)

## Core Components

### Consensus Layer
- Tendermint/CometBFT for BFT consensus
- Validator modularity and shared security
- ABCI interface for execution/DA communication

### Data Availability Layer
- Erasure coding (Reed-Solomon) for redundancy
- KZG commitments for proof-based DA
- Blobstream for rollup data
- Data Availability Sampling (DAS) for light clients

### Execution Layer(s)
- Pluggable: EVM (Ethermint), WASM (CosmWasm), zkVM, MoveVM
- Rollups choose their VM, post data to DA

### SDK
- CLI and codegen for appchains/rollups
- Protobuf/gRPC APIs for all modules

## Security Features

- **Data Availability Sampling (DAS):** Light clients verify data availability without full downloads
- **Fraud Proofs:** Rollups can submit fraud proofs to protect users
- **Shared Security:** Optional staking layer for chains to borrow security from main validators
