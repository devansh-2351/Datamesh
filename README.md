# DataMesh ‚Äî Modular Layer 1 for Scalable Data Availability & Execution

## üåê Overview
DataMesh is a modular Layer 1 blockchain that decouples the core components of blockchain architecture:

- **Consensus**
- **Execution**
- **Data Availability (DA)**

Inspired by projects like Celestia and EigenLayer, DataMesh is purpose-built for data-intensive dApps ‚Äî AI pipelines, decentralized storage, zero-knowledge proof aggregation, and high-throughput rollups.

## üß† Why Modular?
Traditional blockchains like Ethereum bundle everything (consensus, execution, DA), limiting scalability and flexibility. DataMesh separates them to:
- Allow rollups to offload DA to a scalable base layer
- Support multiple execution environments (EVM, WASM, zkVM)
- Scale throughput horizontally by plugging in new execution chains

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components

### Consensus Layer
- Uses Tendermint or CometBFT for fast-finality PoS consensus.
- Supports validator modularity and shared security with other chains.

### Data Availability Layer
- Integrates erasure coding and KZG commitments for proof-based DA.
- Blobstream-like functionality for rollups (as in Celestia).

### Execution Layer(s)
- Pluggable: EVM, WASM, MoveVM, or zkVM.
- Rollups can choose their own VM while posting data to the DA layer.

### DataMesh SDK
- Dev toolkit for launching modular appchains or sovereign rollups using DataMesh infrastructure.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Use Cases
| Use Case                        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üß† AI Pipelines                  | Offload large ML model weights or training logs onto DA layer, provable integrity. |
| üõ°Ô∏è zkApps                        | Publish large zk proof blobs onchain; layer guarantees they‚Äôre available and verifiable. |
| üìà DeFi Rollups                  | Launch fast, low-cost DeFi rollups that don't worry about DA.                |
| üåç Decentralized Data Marketplaces| Plug into IPFS/Filecoin and let users post/access large datasets with payment rails. |

## üîí Security Features
- **Data Availability Sampling (DAS):** Light clients can verify that data is actually available without downloading it all.
- **Fraud Proofs:** Modular rollups can include fraud proofs to protect users from invalid state transitions.
- **Shared Security:** Optional staking layer for chains to borrow security from main DataMesh validators.

## üöÄ Future Expansion
- **Native Interop Layer:** Similar to IBC, rollups and sovereign chains on DataMesh can communicate.
- **Data Bounties:** Let data providers post datasets on-chain and receive crypto incentives for usefulness or quality.
- **AI Model Verifiability:** Integrate zkML and model provenance tracking as a DA solution.

## üõ£Ô∏è Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Scaffolding & Core Modules
1. **Consensus Layer**
   - Integrate Tendermint/CometBFT as the consensus engine.
   - Define validator set and staking logic (can use Cosmos SDK as a base).
2. **Data Availability Layer**
   - Implement erasure coding (Reed-Solomon).
   - Integrate KZG commitments for proof-based DA.
   - Expose APIs for posting and sampling blobs.
3. **Execution Layer**
   - Integrate Ethermint (EVM on Tendermint) for initial execution.
   - Stub out WASM/zkVM/MoveVM for future expansion.
4. **SDK**
   - CLI to scaffold new appchains/rollups.
   - Codegen for proto definitions and client libraries.
5. **Documentation**
   - Write a comprehensive README and architecture docs.

---

## üèÅ Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Follow instructions in each module's README to set up dependencies
3. Use the SDK to scaffold your own appchain or rollup

You now have a fully functional modular Go codebase for DataMesh with:

- **gRPC servers** for Consensus, Data Availability, and Execution modules.
- **SDK CLI** that can:
  - Start any module‚Äôs gRPC server.
  - Act as a client to call each module‚Äôs API (status, post blob, execute tx).
- **Sample Protobuf definitions** and generated Go code (after you run `protoc`).

---

## Example Usage

**Start a module server:**
```sh
go run sdk/main.go -cmd run-consensus -addr :50051
go run sdk/main.go -cmd run-da -addr :50052
go run sdk/main.go -cmd run-execution -addr :50053
```

**Call APIs as a client:**
```sh
go run sdk/main.go -cmd consensus-status -addr :50051
go run sdk/main.go -cmd da-postblob -addr :50052 -data "hello world"
go run sdk/main.go -cmd execution-execute -addr :50053 -data "tx-bytes"
```

---

You can now:
- Implement real business logic in each module.
- Expand the proto definitions and regenerate Go code as needed.
- Add more CLI commands and developer tools.

If you want to add tests, integrate with Tendermint, or need help with a specific feature, just let me know! 

**You can now:**
- Store a value:  
  ```sh
  go run sdk/main.go -cmd execution-execute -addr :50053 -data '{"type":"set","key":"foo","value":"bar"}'
  ```
- Retrieve a value:  
  ```sh
  go run sdk/main.go -cmd execution-execute -addr :50053 -data '{"type":"get","key":"foo"}'
  ```

---

**Next, I‚Äôll upgrade the Data Availability module to store blobs in memory and return real data on sampling. Would you like to proceed with this, or focus on another module?**
